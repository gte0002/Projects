# AutoBenchmark

Determine the speed of various AceCommon functions and algorithms.

**Version**: AceCommon v1.4.6

**DO NOT EDIT**: This file was auto-generated using `make README.md`.

## Dependencies

This program depends on the following libraries:

* [AceCommon](https://github.com/bxparks/AceCommon)

## How to Generate

This requires the [AUniter](https://github.com/bxparks/AUniter) script
to execute the Arduino IDE programmatically.

The `Makefile` has rules to generate the `*.txt` results file for several
microcontrollers that I usually support, but the `$ make benchmarks` command
does not work very well because the USB port of the microcontroller is a
dynamically changing parameter. I created a semi-automated way of collect the
`*.txt` files:

1. Connect the microcontroller to the serial port. I usually do this through a
USB hub with individually controlled switch.
2. Type `$ auniter ports` to determine its `/dev/ttyXXX` port number (e.g.
`/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`).
3. If the port is `USB0` or `ACM0`, type `$ make nano.txt`, etc.
4. Switch off the old microontroller.
5. Go to Step 1 and repeat for each microcontroller.

The `generate_table.awk` program reads one of `*.txt` files and prints out an
ASCII table that can be directly embedded into this README.md file. For example
the following command produces the table in the Nano section below:

```
$ ./generate_table.awk < nano.txt
```

Fortunately, we no longer need to run `generate_table.awk` for each `*.txt`
file. The process has been automated using the `generate_readme.py` script which
will be invoked by the following command:
```
$ make README.md
```

The CPU times below are given in microseconds. The "samples" column is the
number of `TimingStats::update()` calls that were made.

## CPU Time Changes

**v1.4.4**

* Created the AutoBenchmark, replacing the `examples/Udiv1000` program that
    measured only the `udiv1000()` function. It seems like `examples/Udiv1000`
    underestimated the duration of the `udiv1000()` function for AVR
    processors, probably because it did not sufficiently disable compiler
    optimizations. That program found that that `udiv1000()` took about 5-6
    microseconds on the AVR. The AutoBenchmark program finds that it actually
    takes 16-16 microseconds.

**v1.4.5**

* Upgrade to ESP32 Core v1.0.6. No significant change.

**v1.4.6**

* Upgrade STM32duino Core from 1.9.0 to 2.0.0.
* Upgrade SparkFun SAMD Core from 1.8.1 to 1.8.3.
* No significant change in CPU times.

## Results

The following results are given in unit of microseconds for the single function
being tested, in other words, the `loopCnt` has already been divided. As well,
each benchmark result removes the time taken by the for-loop, so the results
should be pretty close to the time taken by the function if they were isolated.
